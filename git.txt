Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development
Git operates on the principle of creating snapshots or "commits" of your code at different stages, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
